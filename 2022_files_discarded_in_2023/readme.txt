In 2022, Lfd.-Nr. 3549 was assigned falsely to all individuals from 3549 to 3552. 
In 2022, Lfd.-Nr. 2098 had no Lfd.-Nr. assigned (hence in the comment it says NA where Lfd.-Nr. should be).

In 2023, these errors were corrected. Also, in 2023 the script was adapted to directly read the xlsx, which led to marginal differences in some numbers (different rounding). 


The originally submitted 2022 data cannot be used to make distinctions between already reported, update and new data for 2023 since some previously reported fish were changed, also potentially
in unique variables used for identification (i.e. if values and ID (=Lfd.-Nr.) changed, there is no way to find the fish to be updated). 
An edited version of 2022 data would allow to make a distinction between already reported, update and new data; yet, the 2022 data would have been changed and it is uncertain whether these updates/duplicates will be 
correctly recognized by the WGEEL db (will depend on criteria, but again, a change in values and ID makes it impossible).

In principal, these changes should only concern the 5 fish where ID was changed and these can be done manually. However, these changes would be difficult to track since a new "subission" file (which
never was actually submitted) would need to be created for local comparison with the 2023 file. 

Since this is likely to cause confusion and increases the margin for error, all data was newly submitted in 2023.
